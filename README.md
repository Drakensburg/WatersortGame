# WatersortGame
A simple yet fun challenge where we tried to create a Water Sort Game Clone.

## ELABORATION
Within this challenge we where asked to create a fun game where colours had to be matched up and sorted, but only one colour could be moved from one bottle at a time. 
No bottle could be overfilled and all colours in a single bottle had to be the same type in order to win the game.
Thus using stacks and pointers I created a simple yet fun solution.

### PROBLEM-SOLVING
By using SCRUM, I iterated on the same program solving problems feature by feature until the final instance was playable and completeable.
